# Speed Dating with Tinder

![Tinder](https://full-stack-assets.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/M03-EDA/Tinder-Symbole.png)

## Company's Description 📇

[Tinder](https://tinder.com/) is an online dating and geosocial networking application. In Tinder, users "swipe right" to like or "swipe left" to dislike other users' profiles, which include their photos, a short bio, and a list of their interests.

Tinder was launched by Sean Rad at a hackathon held at the Hatch Labs incubator in West Hollywood in 2012.

As of 2021, Tinder has recorded more than 65 billion matches worldwide.

## Project 🚧

The marketing team needs help on a new project. They are experiencing a decrease in the number of matches, and they are trying to find a way to understand **what makes people interested into each other**.

They decided to run a speed dating experiment with people who had to give Tinder lots of information about themselves that could ultimately reflect on their dating profile on the app.

Tinder then gathered the data from this experiment. Each row in the dataset represents one speed date between two people and indicates whether each of them secretly agreed to go on a second date with the other person.

## Goals 🎯

Use the dataset to understand what makes people interested in each other to go on a second date together:
* You may use descriptive statistics
* You may use visualizations

## Scope of This Project 🖼️

Data was gathered from participants in experimental speed dating events from 2002-2004. During the events, the attendees would have a four-minute "first date" with every other participant of the opposite sex. At the end of their four minutes, participants were asked if they would like to see their date again. They were also asked to rate their date on six attributes: Attractiveness, Sincerity, Intelligence, Fun, Ambition, and Shared Interests.

The dataset also includes questionnaire data gathered from participants at different points in the process. These fields include demographics, dating habits, self-perception across key attributes, beliefs on what others find valuable in a mate, and lifestyle information. See the [Speed Dating Data Key document](https://full-stack-assets.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/M03-EDA/Speed+Dating+Data+Key.doc) for details.

## Helpers 🦮

To help you achieve this project, here are a few tips that should help you with data exploration ideas:

* What are the least desirable attributes in a male partner? Does this differ for female partners?
* How important do people think attractiveness is in potential mate selection vs. its real impact?
* Are shared interests more important than a shared racial background?
* Can people accurately predict their own perceived value in the dating market?
* In terms of getting a second date, is it better to be someone's first speed date of the night or their last?

## Deliverable 📬

To complete this project, your team should deliver a notebook with:
* Descriptive statistics
* Visualizations
* Captions and interpretations on how the stats and visualizations are relevant to why people agree to a second date
